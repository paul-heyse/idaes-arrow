# DataFusion 55 + Arrow 59 — Detailed Reference

This is the mechanical layer behind [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): section indexes with verified
line numbers, the pattern→section binding matrix, the principle binding table, decision
trees, and operating rules. Come here when you know *what* you need and want the exact
place to read; use SKILL.md first when you are still classifying the problem.

**Line-number policy: seek by line, cite by section.** Line numbers appear only in this
file's §1 tables (and the §2 P-table), because line numbers move when a document is
regenerated and section identifiers do not. Every index table is headed by the exact
command that re-derives it — if a `Read(offset)` lands on the wrong heading, re-derive
before trusting anything else in that table.

## Document aliases

Aliases follow `docs/spec_index/library-routing.md` §1 and must stay in sync with it.

| Alias | Document (under `docs-code-update/library_ref/`) | Chapters | Lines |

## §1 — Per-document section indexes

### §1.1 `df` / `df-schema` / `df-plan` / `df-calc` — the comprehensive DataFusion reference

Re-derive with:

```bash
rg -n '^# DataFusion Advanced — |^# Part ' docs-code-update/library_ref/datafusion_rust_55_arrow59_comprehensive_advanced_reference_2026-08-23.md
rg -n '^## V[1-6]\) ' docs-code-update/library_ref/datafusion_rust_55_arrow59_comprehensive_advanced_reference_2026-08-23.md
```

**Hazard:** the file contains ~250 spurious h1s — authoring slips shaped like `# C1.6 …`
… `# C13.22 …` and `# 37.3 …`–`# 37.13 …`, plus fenced code comments at column 0 — so
bare `rg '^# '` and a bare `just lib-outline` are noisy. Always use the anchored
patterns above. Front matter: doc plan at line 1, documentation map at 128, expansion
order at 954; the body starts at §0 (line 987). Body chapter h1s carry the prefix
`# DataFusion Advanced — `; the titles below omit it.

**Part I (`df` §0–§40, §40A):**

| § | Line | Title |
|---|---:|---|

| **§40A** | **42638** | **DataFusion 55 source-verified capability reconciliation** |
| §40 | 43245 | Best practices and anti-patterns |

§40A is the authority for what DataFusion 55 actually ships (`ScanArgs`,
`PhysicalPlanningContext`, `apply_expressions`, `replace_children`, statistics contexts,
dynamic filters, `file_row_index()`, merge-into surfaces, `is_strict`,
`convert_to_state`, spill pluggability, work stealing, self-serialization hooks). It
takes precedence over stale illustrative version strings anywhere in the imported deep
dives.

| S11 | 61978 | Logical-plan schema propagation and operator output contracts |
| S12 | 63284 | Nested, partition, and virtual-column schemas |

| S15 | 67657 | Schema security, governance, and tenant isolation |

| §56 | 92426 | Plan serialization, caching, fingerprints, and invalidation |

**Part II-C (`df-calc` C1–C13, from line 94142):**

| § | Line | Title |

| C13 | 113681 | Aggregate UDF state design |

**Part III (upgrade gates, h2s from line 115485).** Note the physical order: **V6 sits
between V4 and V5 in the file** — a "V1–V5" sweep misses the corrections log.

| Gate | Line | Title |
|---|---:|---|
| V1 | 115487 | Compile-time trait gate |
| V2 | 115510 | Schema and source gate |
| V3 | 115523 | Calculation gate |
| V4 | 115540 | Plan/reproducibility gate |
| V6 | 115553 | Source-verified corrections incorporated in this revision |
| V5 | 115584 | Final source-of-truth rule |

### §1.2 `arrow` — the standalone Arrow 59 reference

Re-derive with:

```bash
rg -n '^# [0-9]+\) ' docs-code-update/library_ref/arrow_rust_59_datafusion55_advanced_reference_2026-08-23.md
```

and drop any hit at a line ≤ 590 (one stray in-catalog h1 sits at line 427).

**Hazards:** the file is h2-rooted at line 1, so `just lib-outline` starts mid-file. The
preamble topic map promises chapters 29 (security/malformed input) and 30
(PyArrow-to-Rust migration recipes), but the **body ends at §28** — those two exist only
as catalog stubs. Four in-body pointers (~lines 10991, 15554, 16836, 20370) cite retired
predecessor references; the doc's own version matrix and refresh notes supersede them.
The preamble's migration ledger and six subsection titles name predecessor release
versions — never copy those headings verbatim into any tracked file (see REFERENCE §4
rule 4).

**Preamble blocks (h2, lines 1–598):** doc plan (1) · canonical version matrix (8) —
Arrow/Parquet/Flight/Avro 59.2.0, DataFusion 55.0.0, `object_store` 0.13.2,
`pyo3-arrow` 0.19.0 · migration ledger, 58→59 (25) · Parquet/object-store migration
note (73) · Python zero-copy interop migration (91) · combined-stack invariants (105) ·
topic map (148–577) · recommended deep-dive order (578).

**Body chapters (h1 `# N)`, §0–§28):**

| § | Line | Title |
|---|---:|---|
| §0 | 599 | Scope, versioning, and mental model — Rust equivalents for PyArrow capabilities |

## Current principles and optional alignment

The current P1–P36 guidance is in `docs-code-update/library_ref/full_data_fabric_design_principles_v2.md`. Alignment manuals are optional capability references. Their former workflow/artifact matrices are retired; use current headings with `just lib-outline`. No principle crosswalk or exhaustive API survey is required before implementation. Preserve native API details from the indexes above and verify current Cargo source selections when using them.
